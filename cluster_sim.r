## the plot of merge heights and by visual inspection of the dendogram). If we choose two 
## clusters, it looks like most of the observations with means +/- 1 group together, and 
## most of the observations with mean +/- 0.5 group together.

## assignment of observation to groups. That doesn't mean that the grouping is real. Here
## is an example where there is *no* grouping. There is no obvious place in the dendogram 
## where group separation jumps, and the plot of merge heights has no obvious "scree."
